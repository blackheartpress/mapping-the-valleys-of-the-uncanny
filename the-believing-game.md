### The Believing Game

When I was a kid I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time at high
ceilings imagining what it would be like to be in that upside down world in the
ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.
