I want to write about the MPC. It wasn't until much later that I realizsed that
the magical machine that I had heard about was the mpc. I first heard the story
when I was a kid listening to Public Enemy. Then finally when I was older from a
guy who showed me J-Dilla's Donuts. He told me the story as we were listening to
the album together. It was interleaved. The story was. It got interrupted by "oh
oh and check this part out". Little things about the production. Details. They
say the devil is in the details. Anuway I really got that story handed to me.
The last celebrated experimental hip hop record. Didn't have any rapping on it.
The story goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness.
Had his MPC on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's true. I
guess I've put off trying to find out if it's true because I like the story.
"A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true." That bit is from
Steve Martin's LA Story. In the movie I think we're meant to think it's a
Shakespeare quote. That's a nother one I've thought a thousand times about and
never got to the bottom of.

Oooh here's a great source:
