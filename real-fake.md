### The Real and the fake

There is a line between The Real and the fake. This position is defended at any
cost. The Real can not, _must_ not, allow itself to be devauled. A great many
people have invested heavily in doing difficult things. 

Shortcuts are frowned upon.

Authenticity of what exactly?

Value to be traded in for what?

Tradition to be upheld for what purpose?

Cutting corners implies future weakness of structural integrity.
And so it goes. Positions of power are upheld. Barriers to entry kept in place.
Nothing we can do.

"...through layers of diminishing reality"

"...half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real"

"...counterfeit unreality"

The only satisfactions available are the satisfactions of reality, which are themselves frustrating.

"Round Robins are a method of recording a number of performances of the same sample so that when playing repeated notes in fast succession you don’t get “machine gunning” a rapid repeat of the same sample that gives the game away immediately."

I can envision a future where people complain about musicians using telekinesis and longing for the days when real musicians used computers.

Statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but statements of what is known with different degrees of certainty.
