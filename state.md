Static or in flux. The fan in the Robert Miles on ai safety video is the intitial instance that made me think of this.

It�s all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity�, and this music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted � the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often produces pissweak sounds.
