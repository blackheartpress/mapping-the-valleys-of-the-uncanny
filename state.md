Static or in flux. The fan in the Robert Miles on ai safety video is the intitial instance that made me think of this.
Has to do with the presentation aspect. I work on the code until it reaches a static state which is most to my liking. While I might not listen to an eternity's worth of the generated material I'll listen to a good long while. The longest I have in the past listened to a material to make sure I liked all of the material I generated with a atatic piece of code is 8 and a half hours. I did that for No value without utility which can be found here: https://danielmkarlsson.github.io/

It�s all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity�, and this music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted � the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often produces pissweak sounds.
