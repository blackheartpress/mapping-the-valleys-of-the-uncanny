# Introduction

_An investigation into process and method within the field of algorithmic
composition._

_The role of instrumentation and timbre as they unwittingly
conspire to designate access, power, work and ultimately class._  

(I might have to walk this second description back to some extent)

Three hours from opening to closing including intermissions. New Computer Music
compositions presented within the framework of an evening at Fylkingen. A linear
sequence of stereophonic fixed media single screen video files depicting a kind
of stylized visit to an Internet site. Entirely through composed deterministic
realisations with no live instrumentalists. Each of the three sets will have a
duration of about 40 minutes each and will allow for about 20 minute
intermissions after each set. The three sets will contain presentations of sonic
materials interspersed with excerpts from the thesis using speech synthesis and, 
possibly questions posed by my friend Blue. Hopefully leaning towards conversation
in style.  

As each material plays comments could be written explaining how each line
contributes to the resultant music. To be performed during LjudOljud on April
6th at Fylkingen. Documented as an Internet site containing all music and text. 

In my thesis I aim to present my thoughts on how my work writing code and making
music might be connected in some hopefully interesting ways to tensions within
my field ("field" used here in a broader sense). My own origin story is likely
another source for clues as to why I am driven to do the things that I do, but
also, why I am broken in the particular way that I am. I'd also like to explore
the possibility of making my thesis valuable to others in terms of it's utility
by including my code. Other ways I'd like to touch upon how value gets created
in a potential listener and or reader is narrative and place. I'll investigate
where my own ideas about organising sound come from by telling stories and
attempting to trace them back to their sources, engaging with them as lore,
particular to myself and, contrastingly, to the wider field of new music. I aim
to maintain course towards a narrow field of research by limiting the scope of
my inquiry to mostly my own music and thoughts, tacking on to a lesser degree my
best guesses as to the origins of both. The task at hand is mainly organising
sound. My ambition is to present a number of materials, both in thought and in
music. In doing so I hope to "tune" the listener's perception of the musical
works held within the project through the means of text in order to allow for
the possibility of greater immersion. 

If possible one idea would be to fill the first set with only "solo" pieces
(pieces which use one set of samples).

After the intermission a duo piece, then a trio piece and so on.

The third set is an ensemble piece. Holding out for
a tutti divisi 100 hundred stem orchestra piece equivalent was, as I had guessed, 
pushing it. That would for sure be the top of the pyramid though.
What I ended up with is a 40 minute piece for large ensmeble.
From one .scd file I have created the entire 40 minute's worth of music that is to 
be contained within the third act. Having completed this task I feel confident that 
no matter what happens now, at least I'll have one set that is ok. Most folks only 
do the one set don't they? 

I think that I can work my way backwards from the end now. I've learned a lot from 
completing the last piece.  

One story that has always fascinated me is the one about Pythagoras divvying up 
strings. Going forward what I'm thinking I'll do is make a 20 minute piece and 
then a 10 minute piece and then a 5 minute piece and so on with smaller and smaller 
ensembles. That way maybe I can show that time is an illusion and that we are all 
here now just passing it, as best we can, hoping it all works out, waiting for 
something, not sure what. Who knows; Maybe we do have a shot at forever after all. 
As long as we draw breath, I would argue that anything is possible.

# Uncannyness

What does it mean to other people? 
Why am I drawn to it?

                           The Uncanny Valley

The role of instrumentation is on the one hand entirely arbitrary to me as I am
certain that the universe is fundamentally indifferent to my existence, and so,
subsequently to which sounds I sequence in what way. None the less
instrumentation is a source of immense fascination for me. Any sound could be
sequenced. Which sounds would I like to sequence? What are my preferences? I know
that I have at times let availability and prevalence to some extent dictate my
choices. I should like to address that with a number of works that make good on
promises of infinite abundance. After all anything is possible in Electronic
Music. Any sound at any time. Timbre of course fascinates composers. 

In my life I have come to regard certain sounds as desirable but illusive. The
price I've had to pay has sometimes been higher than I would have liked in order
to hear them for even the briefest of moments. I've had to work quickly and compromise.
I've felt that the prescribed modus operandi has been error prone and difficult
to utilize towards my ends of organising sound in the ways that I prefer.

Within so called "New Music" there exists a great divide between the electronic
and the acoustic. Certain sounds are not easily reached for someone like me for
one reason or another.

As my work of organizing sound has led me further and further down the path of
algorithmic composition I have grown more and more interested in the role of
contexts and connotations that certain sounds bring about in an audience. I
never really had any deeper context for LinnDrum claps or Gabber kicks of my own
apart from the obvious fact that they are strictly out of bounds for anyone
looking to make serious music. While that forbidden quality still holds some
titillation I am now much more interested in my own coming into resonance. The
sounds I feel most strongly connected to coming up through New Music where
always out of reach. 

So in very practical terms: I've changed up my way of working. I've gone from
making recordings of musicians playing my scores to now creating sample packs.
Things like the organ have been great because I've been able to do that on my
own. Last year I did a piece for ensemble and through that I met some great
musicians who have been very helpful. Frida Mossop is a great violinist who has
great tone and understands what I want. Also Pau Villa is a percussionist that
I've worked with to create a lot of material. There are some other people also
that I've worked with to create some great packs that I am now sequencing. Given
that I am sequencing files in a computer instead of writing scores for humans to
either misunderstand or not care about, new things are possible. I am happy and
the work is progressing. Up to now I've made etudes for single instruments. The
focus going forward is to work up from duo to trio and so on up to larger
ensembles.

Most of the time I feel like I'm a high functioning automaton at best and that
all of my veracious peaks of inspiration are just bright ideas channeled to me
through popular cultural imperialism. That for all of my talk of the need for
newness and weirdness in music I'm just regurgitating things I've heard. Things
I've been taught to think, do and to make into sound. So I struggle. With
tremendous doubt. I'm trying to find something new to say even though I know
everything has been said a thousand times. I guess I'd be lucky if I can end up
with a subtle difference in emphasis or tone. The information conveyed it self;
Now that would be something.  But that is so much further down the rabbit hole.

So certain things are different when sequencing sounds in a computer. Sounds can
be played faster. That's interesting because we have that faster playing in
music played by humans also. It's exciting because a lot of the time it gets
held up as virtuostic. We use phrases like gifted or talented musicians.  A
computer can play _exactly_ the same amplitude and timbre multiple times in a
row. Humans can't, well actually the constraint is higher up than that. Simple
physics, Newtoninan forces won't allow it. We've never held that kind of
virtuosity up as equilibristic instrumentalist practise. I don't think we'd
react quite the same way if a human got even remotely close. "You sound like a
machine" they'd say. It would be derogatory. They might not even know what
machine they'de be referring to. It would be the sampler and more specifically
an early days sampler with a single layer of samples. No round-robin switching
out of the samples to mimic what happens "naturally" when a key is struck on a
Celesta. An infinite amount of the subtlest variation explodes out of that
action each time.

# The Real and the fake

(Big section proly. What is real? Ideally prove that all that can be heard is real.  
Only imaginings are unreal) Fictions. Narratives. Lores. Stories we tell ourselves.  
Admitting the impossibility in knowing one self and still choosign to live with  
these stories as an attempt at that goal of understanding.
I need to tell the story of the japanese poetry group around year 1000 who allowed  
each other to take new names every decade or so to start each decade with a fresh  
voice. To become the resplendant new. The untainted eye. As many times over as  
they wished for as long as they lived and wrote. THat story is maybe where I'd like  
to go. To get to a point where I feel free to reinvent myself as an artist. 
Get that sweet Zizek action in here.

That which resists symbolization 

“The real is what resists symbolization absolutely.” ― Jacques Lacan, The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Freud's Papers on Technique

Define hyperReal.
Even better than the real thing.
Hightened states of being, as in the impossibility of hearing a multitude of things sounding in a multitude spaces, at a multitide of different times all at once. Transcending limitations of time and space through nonRealtime assemblage.
There is a line between The Real and the fake. This position is defended at any
cost. The Real can not, _must_ not, allow itself to be devauled. A great many
people have invested heavily in doing difficult things. 

Shortcuts are frowned upon.

Authenticity of what exactly?

Value to be traded in for what?

Tradition to be upheld for what purpose?

Cutting corners implies future weakness of structural integrity.
And so it goes. Positions of power are upheld. Barriers to entry kept in place.
Nothing we can do.

"Round Robins are a method of recording a number of performances of the same sample so that when playing repeated notes in fast succession you don’t get “machine gunning” a rapid repeat of the same sample that gives the game away immediately."

_ Quote taken from some manual for some percussion sample library somewhere at some time or another.

I can envision a future where people complain about musicians using telekinesis and longing for the days when real musicians used computers.

Statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but statements of what is known with different degrees of certainty.

# The MPC

(Origin stories, lore, compare the brush, hyperReal tape recorder, hi & lo culture.)  
When the story of our origin (specifically New Music's origin) is told through the 
perspective Then the tape recoder grows to the size of the studio with undeniable 
monumental prestige. If we adjust the point of departure to adjust the scope of our 
story to use the MPC as the starting point an alternative telling of history emerges. 
The story we now construct has ramifications for where density is found. Closer to our 
time. Preferably in the now. Year zero is no longer 1930 with that of the americans 
liberating the tape recorder from the rubble of nazi germany. Instead the year is 1988. 
Public Enemy burst into a popular culture running at break-neck-speed  with their debut 
release It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. Our origin story is no longer 
one of  first meanderings of applying an alien technology inside of a void. Instead the 
very modus operandi is referentiality. The sampler and sampling not the tape recorder 
and tape recordings. Very the history of Electronische Muziek begins with the tape 
recorder and then explodes outward into the physical monument of the studio our new 
origin story is one of implosion. Both stories originate from a single machine. 
Samplers inside of computers are direct descendentsof the MPC. They now have no 
physical form. They are software. They computer disappears into generalization. 
A computer can perform the task of any specialized machine like the tape recorder 
or the sampler. A general purpose computer. Acorporeal. Purpose defined in software.

I want to write about the MPC. It wasn't until much later that I realizsed that
the magical machine that I had heard about was the mpc. I first heard the story
when I was a kid listening to NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul. Then finally when I was 
older from aguy who showed me J-Dilla's Donuts. He told me the story as we were 
listening to the album together. It was interleaved. The story was. It got 
interrupted by "oh oh and check this part out". Little things about the production. 
Details. Theysay the devil is in the details. Anyway I really got that story handed 
to me. The last celebrated experimental hip hop record. Didn't have any rapping on it.
The story goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness.
Had his MPC on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's true. I
guess I've put off trying to find out if it's true because I like the story.
"A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true." That bit is from
Steve Martin's LA Story. In the movie I think we're meant to think it's a
Shakespeare quote. That's a nother one I've thought a thousand times about and
never got to the bottom of.

# Pinecones are magical

(I'd like to change your mind about everything you know in your heart of hearts to be true) 
Up is down. Bad is good.
While I don't believe in actual magic I find this passage from Jarod Anderson's The CryptoNaturalist useful for purposes
of illustration:

"Pinecones are beautiful, geometric wonders that are only devalued by their
abundance. Fractal sculptures. Evergreen snowflakes. Blossoms in wood.
(Familiarity can rust magic. A little mental effort returns the shine.)" 

_ The CryptoNaturalist @CryptoNature 2018-08-24

https://twitter.com/CryptoNature/status/1032808690292797440

I would like to return the shine, as it were, to the task of organising sound in
general and to working with algorithimic composition in particular. 
Stretch goals would be to influence people to join me in rewiring the term
Computer Music to hold a new meaning. One tailored specifically to fit our time.
As computers are no longer held in artificial scarcity but rather available in
abundance new ways of thinking and acting in the world are possible.

Oram's new Atlantis:
“We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all sounds, and
their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and
lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music likewise to you unknown,
some sweeter than any you have, together with bells and rings that are dainty
and sweet. We represent small sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds
extenuate and sharp; we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in
their original are entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and
letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps
which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers strange
and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as it were tossing
it: and some that give back the voice louder than it came, some shriller, and
some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice differing in the letters or
articulate sound from that they receive. We have also means to convey sounds in
trunks and pipes, in strange lines and distances.”

_ “The New Atlantis” – Francis Bacon, 1623

That's some story. Actually, for me it's a story wrapped in another story.
Daphne Oram put that quote on the wall at The BBC Radiophonic Workshop and
_that's_ the story I've been told.
 
Do you remember the story of Daft punk? 
Everything was recorded onto analog tape in rarified recording palaces like New
York's Electric Lady and L.A.'s Capitol Studios. Human spontaneity was coveted;
computers, with their tendency toward mindless repetition, were not.

“Technology has made music accessible in a philosophically interesting way,
which is great,” says Bangalter, talking about the proliferation of home
recording and the laptop studio. “But on the other hand, when everybody has the
ability to make magic, it's like there's no more magic—if the audience can just
do it themselves, why are they going to bother?”  

[link](https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/)

Ryan Dombal's Daft Punk interview for Pitchfork that came out in May 2013 is
riddled with descriptions of the interviewees affluance. We are told a story of
success through appearances. I imagine the article had the opposite of the
intentended effect on me. I love the idea of democratising the means of
production.

Take your fingers right up to your ears. As close as you can get them without
touching your ears. Now rub your fingers together ever so gently. You can hear
that can't you. Now imagine trying to hear such a faint sound across from a
concert hall or even just a a stage. You would not be able to. Now image an
orchestra. Something close to a hundred people. They wouldn't be able to fit
there with all of their instruments in that close proximity where you heard that
faint sound of your fingers rubbung together just now. Right there is where I
put the microphone. Each time, as close as I can get it. For each instrument and
somtimes even changing the placement to optimize fully for a particular
articulation.

# Rooms

(Ties into place. The absurdity and poetic nature of imagining beleiveing that a photograph can steal a soul) 
I've come to understand that my fascination for room tones is connected to my
confusion about my class identity. Mimer first. I didn't realize it at the time.
And then later, The Machine Hall in Ställberg. It was right under my nose then
but it took me quite a while to piece the puzzle together. It's impossible for
the narrative component of which space I use to travel to the distance to the
listener on it's own. For me it's different. I know the name of the convolution
file. I can imagine the workers there. Through a wrinkle in time. Working,
ceaselessly, dutifully. And now that the lightning has been caught in the bottle
I can imagine that work filling that room with sound. From the lowest rumbles
through the spectrum all the way up the ladder to the harshest height of the
audible spectrum. At the end of it we subtract time and we've captured if not
the room itself then it's essence, or if you care to indulge me, it's soul. My
fascination has been focusing in on trying to pin down the work that happened
there. It can't be saved for later and understood given enough time. My origin
story will always elude me. If these walls could talk we say. My thoughts
connect things up and make patterns. Compare another cavernous room tone; The
church. A place of worship. A place to wonder in awe of god's greatness. The
organ was the first big organised sound. That room is part of how we've heard
that instrument. The resonance. Place and narrative intersect in the tone of the
room. As the room resonates we are brought into resonance with ideas. I never
believed in god. I never believed that narrative. I know work was real. The
workers were real. Their struggle was real. I believe in that narrative.


# State

The code is static. Why is that important? 
The frozen state yielding a multitude of infinities in variation through time fascinates me. Feels paradoxical. Goes on to talk about complexity. The scope or sampling window matters.
Static or in flux. The fan in the Robert Miles on ai safety video is the intitial instance that made me think of this.
Has to do with the presentation aspect. I work on the code until it reaches a static state which is most to my liking. While I might not listen to an eternity's worth of the generated material I'll listen to a good long while. The longest I have in the past listened to a material to make sure I liked all of the material I generated with a atatic piece of code is 8 and a half hours. I did that for No value without utility which can be found here: [link](https://danielmkarlsson.github.io/)

By projecting static code in combination with fixed media is for the greater part due to my fascination for complexity i 
emerging out of simplicity. To a smaller degree I cant help but go against the prescribed modus operandi of playing the code
within so called live coding like an instrument. That is not what I want to do. I want to organise sound in a very specific
way. Another nice aspect of static code is that it greatly increases portability. I think I'd be a lot more interested in distributing something that was not video. Who knows what the future will hold.

Might be fun also to touch briefly on the idea of state as memory as in functional programming in general and Haskell in particular. At least the personal encounters part. THat whole engage with it as lore thing again.

"The only state is time"
How to talk about this without giving power to it's source.
 
It's all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity, and this music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted and the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often produces pissweak sounds.

# The Believing Game

When I was a kid I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time at high
ceilings imagining what it would be like to be in that upside down world in the
ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.  

I most likely will have to reference [this](https://github.com/danielmkarlsson/library/blob/master/Peter%20Elbow%20-%20The%20Believing%20Game--Methodological%20Believing.pdf)
