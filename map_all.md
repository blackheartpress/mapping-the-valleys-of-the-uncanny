# Establising a baseline    

Greg Egan writes in Diaspora:

"Every orphan was an explorer, sent to map uncharted territory. And every orphan
was the uncharted territory itself."

I've been a composer for a while now. I've been envolved with music in a lot of
different ways through the course of getting to where I'm at now, in this
moment, that has me writing this text. There have been different frameworks at
different times and those different frameworks have all come bundled with their
own set of different limitations. This kind of thing is always difficult to take
apart but I think that, at least sometimes, those limitations have inspired me.
They definitely affected the way my music sounded, that much I can tell you is
for sure. 

One way that I like to think about these frameworks is the word project.
Learning to play the guitar was a project. Learning to record myself playing the
guitar was another. Playing in a band came next. Learning to structure sound
together with friends sprung to life out of that. If we fast forward through all
of the links in the chain we arrive at the overarching project of organising
sound, and then, this particular example of that.

One fundamental difference between acoustic and electronic music is that
electronic music can be ungoverned by newtonian forces. I think that is entirely
amazing. Any sound can arrive at any time. There need not be a sounding body or
physical object present in front of you. I hear someone in the back yelling
about speakers. Sure, sure, sure but we don't have to get stuck there.
Acousmatic music was a thing. I acknowledge that. No need to substitute one
fetichisation of the corporeal with another going forward. The speaker is a
conduit, or put another way; a funnel. Thinking about it as a filter can be fun
but messy. What interests me is the stuff going through the funnel and how to
make it. 

Let's move on to what we are afforded from following the line of thinking that
we are free from the shackles of the finite and of the physical world. Sound now
enjoys morphological freedom through a myriad of transformations. It is malleble
to the utmost degree. We have at our disposal an astounding plethora of tools
through which to manipulate and organise sound.

This project is a collection of musical materials that explore the idea of the
uncanny valley as it relates to music being real, fake or some strange
combination of the two. This project is primarily one in which I produce sound
files. In a secondary capacity I am also producing a text file.

In my thesis I aim to present some of my thoughts on how my work writing code
and making music might be connected in some hopefully interesting ways to my
field. I am unlikely to be able to adequately convey my own origin story.
Instead I'll focus on stories I've been told about music, throughout my life,
inside and outside of academia. I have a strong suspicion that these stories
have shaped my coming into being as a composer. However difficult the task of
introspection, and ultimately to know one self proves to be, I at least regard
these stories as a source for clues as to why I am driven to do the things that
I do. I don't think that there can be anything like "the self" without others
and that "the self" is largely about imagining others view of yourself.

I'd also love to try to  make my thesis valuable to others in terms of it's
utility. This is why I've chosen to include my code. My thinking here is that
there exists a certain kind of reader that won't want to sit through these
touchy feely meanderings unless there is a promise of some code that can be run
at the end of the day. One way of thinking about those pieces of code is as
maps. You would be free to connect my code to anything you want and control it.
You could make your own connections to the things you care about. Edit my code
to find your own path through the valley.

In the diagram below the audience creates a discrete assesment loop when viewing
the artwork. The audience views the result of the artist's process of composing
the work and then goes on about their lives. Some particular work by some
particular artist may resonate more with some individual human being held within
the mass that is the audience. The prescribed modus operandi for this individual
is then to take an interest in the artist, or rather the story that has been
constructed about the artist. To be neatly consumed, perhaps in the form of a
biography or an interview. I don't think this model serves us very well. At
least not on it's own. Instead if we were to share our code the audience is more
likely to be empowered to do something other than to continue to go about their
lives as consumers. Consumers of musics and of stories about artists. Perhaps
idolizing them. Putting the artist and subconsciously the idea that they
themselves as part of an audience could create something, anything. Constructed
narratives designed to create cult followings are not helping to deepen the
audience's relationship with the artwork. Giving the audience access to the code
might not do that all of the time but it is a thing to try instead of going
along with a prescribed method.

[Publishing as cybernetic practice](http://avant.org/artifact/stephen-willats/)

I have had a bunch of experiences prior to working on this project. I have made
and heard a whole lot of music. Not only that but basically everything that has
ever happened to me and the things that I have come to believe, about myself and
about the world, I take with me into this new project. That happens with every
project. The particulars of the framework surrounding this project really makes
me very aware of that. Same thing goes for a listener. They also bring
everything with them into listening. They might not know it but that's how it
is. Nothing happens in a vacuum. The two discrete loops are kept separate
though. That's how I like to think about it. I need to create music to keep
myself balanced but that doesn't mean that I surrender my privacy. The
listener shouldn't have to either. 

I've learned a lot from working on this project. It's been very freeing in a lot
of ways. I feel like I got over myself in some ways. Also I dug down deep and
pushed through some issues. I spent a lot longer coming back to pieces adding to
and changing things about them. I know that doesn't matter though. What I mean
to say is: No one can ever hear how long any piece of music took to write. How
much effort went into making it. How much struggle. How many demons overcome.
Sound is just wiggly air. It is also my favourite thing to do with the time that
I have.  Also I don't think I'm hurting anyone. So that's what I'm doing. Making
the air wiggle in a praticular way that interests me here in the right now.


# Uncanniness

It can mean a lot of different things.
Let's have a look in a dictionary:

• Having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis.   
• Beyond the ordinary or normal.   
• Extraordinary.   

"Uncanny accuracy; An uncanny knack of foreseeing trouble."

• Mysterious.   
• Arousing superstitious fear or dread.  
• Uncomfortably strange.   

"Uncanny sounds filled the house."    

[Link to source](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/uncanniness)

Let me make an attempt at explaining why am I drawn to it. First off it strikes
me as contemporary seeing as we are all living through post truth and secondly
because I regard it as largely unexplored when thought of as a musical
parameter. It turns out originality, or otherness is important to me.

Unicanniness looks unexplored enough as a space to peek my interest. From where
I'm standing uncaniness being largely unexplored is true. See what I did there?

Practical example of how I've come to think of uncanniness as a musical
parameter within the scope of this project: Say I want to write some music for
strings. There are many sample libraries to choose from. So it's which one I
choose, first off, but it goes deeper. These libraries all exist on a spectrum
ranging from authentic sounding to blatantly ficticious. It interests me to
think about where a praticular library lands on that spectrum for an imagined
listener. After that there are aspects of how a library is recorded and
scripted that influence me to make all kinds of choices regarding the
conscruction of the music. Dynamics and registration most especially but in some
cases even pitch material has revealed itself to me through this lens.  

It has been inspiring to read about [Masahiro Mori's thoughts about
[The Uncanny Valley](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/the-uncanny-valley)  
and through that finding [Banraku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku
). It has impacted my view of the world and about how reality is something we
all hold together be reenacting. We are constantly reminding each other of how
to behave and what to regard as real and what to discard as unreal. Or as
William Gibson put it in Neuromancer: 

"A consensual hallucination". 

We both know Gibson was talking about something a little different when he wrote
that. That's part of what interests me about sampling. We can both refer to, and
at the same time recontextualize anything that has previously been recorded,
either as sound or as text. When we quote text we are bringing the context of
academia at least and perhaps even of The Enlightenment with us. We are standing
on the shoulders of giants. Literally all of recorded history. Kept safe for us
so that we might learn from it. With sampling of audio it's a little different.
Intellectual property laws forbid it. You would have to get permission from the
rights holders to make a derivative work and then give away all of your
potential profit to them. 

How does artists receiving fractions of pennies per stream impact this?

How does listeners having access to "all" of the music ever recorded impact
this?  
We know it can't be "all" of it, but alas, that is how it is marketed.

As my work of organizing sound has led me further and further down the path of
algorithmic composition I have grown more and more interested in the role of
contexts and connotations that certain sounds bring about in an audience. I
never really had any deeper context for LinnDrum claps or Four Operator FM
Synthesis. No contexts that I regarded as my own except for the obvious context
that these sounds are strictly out of bounds for anyone looking to make serious
music. While that forbidden quality still holds some titillation I have moved on
to thinking that for the most part; No one cares. Don't worry. This is a good
thing. Trust me. It means that we are free. Free to dream endlessly and to make
anything we want. Absolutely free. Steve Martin wrote about this in LA Story:

"...no one is looking [to the outside] for verification that what they're doing
is ok."

Getting back to practicalites; Certain things are different when sequencing
sounds in a computer. Sounds can be played faster. That's interesting because we
have that faster playing in music played by humans also. It's intersting because
a lot of the time it gets held up as virtuosic in different ways in different
genres. We use phrases like gifted or talented musicians. A computer can play
_exactly_ the same amplitude and timbre multiple times in a row. Humans can't,
well actually the constraint is higher up than that. Simple physics, Newtonian
forces won't allow it. We've never held that kind of virtuosity up as
equilibristic instrumentalist practice. I don't think we'd react quite the same
way if a human got even remotely close. "You sound like a machine" they'd say.
It would be derogatory. They might not even know what machine they'd be
referring to. It would be the sampler and more specifically an early days
sampler with a single layer of samples. No round-robin switching out of the
samples to mimic what happens "naturally" when a key is struck on a Steinway at
different velocities. An infinite amount of the subtlest variation explodes out
of that action each time. The cross talk inside the body of the instrument as
multiple keys are struck elevate the richness of timbral interplay to
immesurable hights of exponentiallity.


# The notion of The Real.

I need to tell the story of the Japanese poetry group around year 1000 who
allowed each other to take new names every decade or so to start each decade
with a fresh voice. To become the resplendent new. The untainted eye. A new
voice through which to speak about new perspectives. As many times over as they
wished for as long as they lived and wrote. That story is maybe where I'd like
to go. To get to a point where I feel free to reinvent myself as an artist.   

I find my own thinking aligning with parts of Slavoj Zizek's in The Reality of
the Virtual: 

"...when I deal with you, I'm basically not dealing with the real you. I'm
dealing with the virtual image of you. And this image has reality, in the sense
that it, none the less, structures the way I am dealing with you. And then
this idealization is crucial." 

I substitute the interactions of two individual human beings with an audience's
experiencing of an artwork. I also feel that idealization is crucial within this
project as well. Had there not been this idealized view of acoustic instruments
then there would be no foundation to build my castles in the sky upon. I am
trying to relate to my surroundings somehow by creating these works.

"This would be the first elementary level: Imaginary virtual, in the sense of
the virtual image which determines how we interact with other people. Virtual
image in the sense of: Although we interact with real people, we erase, we
behave as if whole strata of the other person are not there."

I here substitute "real people" with artworks and "the whole strata" as the
process which has led to the result that is the artwork; The file. The .wav for
or .pdf for example. 

"[An] example of how the virtual dimension is operative at the symbolic level
would have been beliefs. Are we aware to what extent our beliefs today are
virtual? By virtual I mean, in this case, attributed to others, presupposed.
They don't actually exist, they are virtual, in the sense that nobody really has
to believe, we only have to presuppose another person to believe." 

An example of a virtual symbolic belief in our neck of the woods would be the
story of how Gil Evans arranged Sketches of Spain. The story goes that he's a
genius for arranging in such a way that instruments that were very widely apart
in terms of their audibility, were they to be stood on a stage together, could
be made to fit snugly in a mix. Contrastingly there's the story of how a 1930's
first-timer studio musician asked a recording engineer if there oughtn't be more
than one microphone in the room. The recording engineer then proceeds to laugh
and ask if the musician intends to record more than one record simoultaniosly?
The recording engineer goes on to explain that whomever in the ensemble has a
solo should take a step closer to the microphone. 

In the music that I have produced for this project the presupposition of others
is that acoustic music is created by living breathing human beings. They are
using a very special type of physical object which is a musical instrument.
Ideally this happens in a special type of physical space which is a concerthall.
This is how recordings get made. Any infringement upon that fact is unthinkable
to this imagined audience which holds these virtual beliefs. This is Zizek's
efficacity as it gave me something to relate to when I made the music for this
project.

Even better than the real thing. 

Heightened states of being, as in the impossibility of hearing a multitude of
things sounding in a multitude spaces, at a multitude of different times all at
once. Transcending limitations of time and space through non realTime
assemblage.

# The MPC

(Origin stories, lore, compare the brush, hyperReal tape recorder, high & low
culture. Maybe even status.)  

If the tape recorder was hyperReal then the MPC is hyperHyperReal
(compare postPostModern) and controlling Kontakt with SuperCollider is
infinitely hyperRealised in comparison to the original origin story.  

When the story of our origin (specifically Electronic Music's origin) is told
through the perspective of the tape recorder being the start. Then later the
tape recorder grows to the size of the studio with undeniable monumental
prestige. If we adjust the point of departure to a more recent technological
breakthrough then the scope of our story changes dramtically. To use the MPC as
the starting point for an alternative telling of history emerges as an
oppourtunity.  

The story we now construct has ramifications for where density occours. Closer
to our time. Preferably in the now. Year zero is no longer 1930 with that of
the Americans liberating the tape recorder from the rubble of nazi Germany.
Instead the year is 1988.    
Public Enemy burst into a popular culture running at
break-neck-speed with their debut release It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold
Us Back. Our origin story is no longer one of first meanderings of applying an
alien technology inside of a void. Instead the very modus operandi is
referentiality. The sampler and sampling not the tape recorder and tape
recordings. 

The history of Electronische Musik begins with the tape recorder and then
explodes outward into the physical monument of the studio. Our new origin story
is one of implosion. Both stories originate from a single machine.  

Sampler software inside of computers are direct descendants of the MPC. They now have no physical
form. They are software. The computer disappears into generalization.  A
computer can perform the task of any specialized machine like the tape recorder
or the sampler. A general purpose computer. Incorporeal. Purpose defined in
software.

It wasn't until much later that I realised that
the magical machine that I had heard about was the MPC. I first heard the story
when I was a kid listening to NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul. Then finally when I was 
older from a guy who showed me J-Dilla's Donuts. He told me the story as we were 
listening to the album together. It was interleaved. The story was. It got 
interrupted by "oh oh and check this part out". Little things about the production. 
Details. They say the devil is in the details. Anyway I really got that story handed 
to me. The last celebrated experimental hip hop record. Didn't have any rapping on it.
The story goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness.
Had his MPC on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's true. I
guess I've put off trying to find out if it's true because I like the story.
"A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true." That bit is from
Steve Martin's LA Story. In the movie I think we're meant to think it's a
Shakespeare quote. That's a another one I've thought a thousand times about and
never got to the bottom of.

There might be a way to way to fit the John Cage on tour in Europe with Earl
Brown and Christian Wolff story in here. The story goes that they were all on
tour together and their musics all utilized the idea that if there is a
sufficient amount of silence in between notes then the listener will forget the
previous note. John Cage finds that after hearing the same program being played
night after night in city after city he begins to hear melodies in all of their
pieces. Prolonged exposure. Even just practice. It ends up in your memory even if
you don't want it to. Cage focused on just the notes in this example. To my mind
there would have still been the compunded infinities of timbre and timing. With
the MPC in it's first iteration I'm thinking this was most apparent. Hit that
pad and get exactly the same sound every time. Later models in my time have been
marketed as having  velocity through pressure sensitivity bulit into the pads.
Not sure  but I think they returned to the flat no dynamics when they made an
iOS version. The MPC then acorporeal, reduced to pictures under glass. The
retriggering anyway. The "machineGunning". That's what I think became what made
the MPC so interesting in how it was perceived. Lifeless, or even undead, like a
zombie. The corpse moves, and in such marvellously different ways.

Sampling as a radical act? Here then maybe the idea that there were
possibilities presented to artists in the past (a very special brush) that for
whatever reason have been insufficiently explored. Paradoxically taking on the
role of the old hat at the same time. FM certainly is like that. Additive
synthesis as well. These two examples can easily be thought of through a purely
technical perspective. Since both FM and additive synthesis offer an apparant
abundance in the parameter space it becomes a problem of organsing efforts to
explore them in powerful (abstracted) ways. We are left to our own devices here.
We are not posing a threat to anyone noodling around inside of our belly buttons
engaging with this work. On the other hand sampling isn't comparatively  as
underexplored from a technical perspective. Might could be that there could be a
case to make about how sampling could be underexplored from a referential and
social perspective. This is largely due to how frought with legal concerns
sampling became. There was, I think, a panic that spread quickly. A scrambling
then ensued to safeguard intellectual property belonging to large corporations.

degree of responsibility needs to be taken when occupying a space. When speaking

# Pine cones are magical

(I'd like to change your mind about everything you know in your heart of hearts
to be true) 

Up is down. Bad is good. While I don't believe in actual magic I find this
passage from Jarod Anderson's The CryptoNaturalist useful for purposes of
illustration:

"Pine cones are beautiful, geometric wonders that are only devalued by their
abundance. Fractal sculptures. Evergreen snowflakes. Blossoms in wood.
(Familiarity can rust magic. A little mental effort returns the shine.)" 

[link to source](https://twitter.com/CryptoNature/status/1032808690292797440)

I would like to return the shine, as it were, to the task of organising sound in
general and to working with algorithmic composition in particular. 
Stretch goals would be to influence people to join me in rewiring the term
Computer Music to hold a new meaning. One tailored specifically to fit our time.
As computers are no longer held in artificial scarcity but rather available in
abundance new ways of thinking and acting in the world are possible.

### Oram's new Atlantis: 

I keep coming back this pasage from Francis Bacon's The New Atlantis which was
first published in 1623:

“We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all sounds, and
their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and
lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music likewise to you unknown,
some sweeter than any you have, together with bells and rings that are dainty
and sweet. We represent small sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds
extenuate and sharp; we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in
their original are entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and
letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps
which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers strange
and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as it were tossing
it: and some that give back the voice louder than it came, some shriller, and
some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice differing in the letters or
articulate sound from that they receive. We have also means to convey sounds in
trunks and pipes, in strange lines and distances.”

That's some story. Actually, for me it's a story wrapped in another story.
Daphne Oram put that quote on the wall at The BBC Radiophonic Workshop and
_that's_ the story I've been told.

Take your fingers right up to your ears. As close as you can get them without
touching your ears. Now rub your fingers together ever so gently. You can hear
that can't you. Now imagine trying to hear such a faint sound across from a
concert hall or even just a stage. You would not be able to. Now imagine an
orchestra. Something close to a hundred people. They wouldn't be able to fit
there with all of their instruments in that close proximity where you heard that
faint sound of your fingers rubbing together just now. Right there is where I
put the microphone. Each time, as close as I can get it. It's the place were a
lover whispers to you. For each instrument and sometimes even changing the
placement to optimize fully for a particular articulation. We are taught that
close proximity is dangerous and can lead to an exagurated low end. I feel it is
easier and sounds better to subtract from a signal rather than add to it and
anyone who knows that I have a strong preference for the lower end of the
spectrum. If need be cut the bass and add a room, any room, later. Get as much
of the signal as you can when you have it. Just make sure it doesn't clip.


# Rooms

( Ties into place.  
The absurdity and poetic nature of us imagining someone having
believed that a photograph could steal a soul. ) 

I've come to understand that my fascination for room tones is connected to my
confusion about my class identity. Mimer first. I didn't realize it at the time.
And then later, The Machine Hall in Ställberg. It was right under my nose then
but it took me quite a while to piece the puzzle together. It's impossible for
the narrative component of which space I use to travel the distance to the
listener on it's own. For me it's different. I know the name of the convolution
file. I can imagine the workers there. Through a wrinkle in time. Working,
ceaselessly, dutifully. And now that the lightning has been caught in the bottle
I can imagine that work filling that room with sound. From the lowest rumbles
through the spectrum all the way up the ladder to the harshest height of the
audible spectrum. At the end of it we subtract time and we've captured if not
the room itself then it's essence, or if you care to indulge me, it's soul. My
fascination has been focusing in on trying to pin down the work that happened
there. It can't be saved for later and understood given enough time. My origin
story will always elude me. If these walls could talk we say. My thoughts
connect things up and make patterns. Compare another cavernous room tone; The
church. A place of worship. A place to wonder in awe of god's greatness. The
organ was the first big organised sound. That room is part of how we've heard
that instrument. The resonance. Place and narrative intersect in the tone of the
room. As the room resonates we are brought into resonance with ideas. I never
believed in god. I never believed that narrative. I know work was real. The
workers were real. Their struggle was real. I believe in that narrative.

Place: Make the case that a piece of code can be thought of as sculpture or as a
place. What are some examples of nice places? The stone garden is a nice story.
The shopping mall is another place. Not as nice a place I don't think. THen
again, I've never experienced a stone garden. The stone garden only exists in my
imagination through having been told stories.
 

# State

The code is static. Why is that important? The frozen state yielding a multitude
of infinities in variation through time fascinates me. Always has.i To construct
something and then for it to take on a life of it's own in a sense. Feels
paradoxical. Goes on to talk about complexity. The scope or sampling window
matters. Static or in flux. Has to do with the presentation aspect. I work on
the code until it reaches a static state which is most to my liking. While I
might not listen to an eternity's worth of the generated material I'll listen to
a good long while. I can be certain that the algorithms combining of parameters
will satisfy me in the same way that I can hear when a piece is finished.  My
choice to project static code in combination with fixed media is for the greater
part due to my fascination for complexity emerging out of simplicity. To a
smaller degree I cant help but go against the prescribed modus operandi of
playing the code within so called live coding like an instrument. That is not
what I want to do. I want to organise sound in a very specific way. Another nice
aspect of static code is that it greatly increases portability.

I got to thinking about state a lot through brushing up against functional
programming. When state is thought of as somehting dirty and dangerous then that
makes it interesting to me. I found workarounds because it wa fun to go against
prescribed ways of working. Also I'd argue that memory is a fundamental aspect
of music as it is a time based medium. You can't say stuff like "There is no
state" or that "Time is the only constant" and not expect people to rebel.

Anyway the whole wanting to stay one hundred percent sqeaky clean all of the
time thing that can happen to functional programmers always struck me as having
more to do with fundamental problems in computer science than about me wanting
to organise sound. Nevermind about all of that. I don't mind so much that there
could potentially be a danger of some unexpected behaviour when I'm making music
by writing code. So long as it makes a sound there is something for me to hear
and to decide what I think of it. I only ever regarded unintended silence as
failure. Anything above that is something I can work with. If I can hear it I a
mcertain that I can decide if I like it or not. How could I not have an opinion
on anything and everthing I hear? As far back as I can remember that's all I've
been doing. Deciding. Making choices based on what I'v been hearing. So it's
real simple. I like simple.i So does Mark Fell and I like Mark Fell.

Mark Fell is quoted as saying the following in Phillip Clark's Manitutshu Wire Review:

"It's all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity, and this
music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted and
the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age
old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often
produces pissweak sounds."

[link to source](http://www.markfell.com/wiki/index.php?n=Mf.Manitutshu)

If I try hard I can still remember that the task of organising sound felt
daunting to me in the beginning. I would think about the inifinite possibilities
of combinatorics and a general dread of the blank page would sneek up on me and
I'd get all wound up. I like to keep things simple. Usually I don't notice that
I've started composing for real until much later. I thought I was just trying to
figure out how something worked. I change one thing at a time and I listen. If I
like what I hear having tweaked that one parameter I'll move on to the next one.
Complexity could yield itself later through the compounding of many simple
choices. I don't go after complexity. I don't shy away from it either. It could
happen and that would be ok so long as I like what I'm hearing. Simple. Reduced
both in terms of thinking about emergence of complexity and also about the work
as just another craft. Do a thing many times in order to get comfortable doing
that thing.

# The Believing Game

The task at hand is mainly organising sound. My ambition is to present a number
of materials, both in thought and in music. In doing so I hope to "tune" the
listener's perception of the musical works held within the project through the
means of text in order to allow for the possibility of greater immersion. 

When I was a kid I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time at high
ceilings imagining what it would be like to be in that upside down world in the
ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.  

I most likely will have to reference

# Conclusion: The Impossibility of The Maps

Nothing is real, everything is permitted. 

The source for this is acknowledged by Burroughs himself in Minutes to Go, p.
61: Nothing is true all is permitted. Last words [of] Hassan Sabbah.
The Old Man of the Mountain quoted from The Master of the Assassins by
Betty Bouthoul. 

[Link to source](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/jefftaylor/publications/origins/)

The quote keeps popping up. Later on in a videogame called
Assasins Creed. Everyone is sampling it. The origin is more blurred by every use
of it. It especially affects searchability on The Public Internet as the search
engine (you know which one, the dominant one) is "optimizing" by finding and
fanning flames into resonances. When a resonance becomes feedback it can be used as a
signal.

Music appreciation is subjective. Who'd a thunk it?

Adam Phillips says that
"The only satisfactions available are the satisfactions of reality, which are
themselves frustrating."
 
Preferences of style exist, aesthetics do not. Since there is no god there can
be no divine beauty. We are left to our own devices down here. We have to make
up our own minds about what we prefer.

So the jist of this text is this: During my Master which was 2017 to 2019 I
changed my way of working with music in a few different ways. Part of it was
changing out the tools I used. I went from using TidaCycles to using
SuperCollider. From using SuperDirt as my sampler to instead using Kontakt. From
using AudioMulch to using Reaper for doing real time post production. So some of
the names of the tools changed but the functionality broadly speaking stayed the
same. The modus operandi is still: Write code that triggers samples and then
apply effects in some kind of DAW-like environment in order to express my
musical ideas. Why should I express my musical ideas? Because I want to and
because I can. The possibility exists and I am drawn to it. The way I make music
is dependant on tools. The tools should be open for others to study and use. If
I don't take measures to make my tools available to others then I am kicking out
the rungs beneath me as I climb upward.

On a cenceptual or extra musical level I am obliged to admit, however
reluctantly, that something changed. Anyone who knows me is always hearing me
tell the same story. About how fundamentally music is incapable of depicting
anything because of the fact that it is inherently abstract and utterly
ephemeral. Despite of how many times I have told that story both to myself, to
my friends and basically anyone within earshot I ended up making a strange kind
of programme music myself. I got to thinking, perhaps too much, about my
environment and about the people I met there. How they work and also about why
they work in the ways that they work. What their goals are. The project ended up
describing my thoughts and emotions about being back in that old world. Feeling
much the same way as before. Like a thief at a cocktail party, trying to blend
in, eating hors d'oeuvres and failing to exchange pleasentries, sweating
profusely, certain of being found out and subsequently thrown out, any second
now. 

### Below are unsorted snippets of random things

If you are doing creative work then to some extent, sure, I think it could be a
good idea to try to write down some of your thoughts about the task at hand from
your perspective. There are a lot of different ways that you could do that. 

"...some are good, some are bad, some are just ok."  - Quentin Dupieux from Lambs Anger

Quotes are a socially exceptable form of sampling.

What's that quote about how the originallity of your ideas being dependent on
the obscourity of your
sources?

What is the utmost of subtlety?

Static/flux  
Stone garden  
Listening as an activity (interactivity)  
Paying attention  

How about narrative and place as two examples of two possible extra musical paths to engagement.

The Vivaldi was a publisher story. The unlikeliness that program music will be
real. Most likely a marketing ploy to pettle goods of some kind. In Vivaldi's
time sheet music was the product. I remember the time in my life when as a
teenager I would go to a record store to listen to music and decide which CD I
would buy. I could afford to buy one per month. I was building my collection
slowly this way. Then later because a lot of strange and complicated reasons I
started lend/leasing compressed files through a platform. I did this through
monthlu subscription which coincidentally is the same amount I paid for the one
CD a month. The say you can listen to any music through this platform but I know
that's not true. The platform being there and seeming so very unquestionable
has led to people attempting to game it. The blandest, most chill music is being
made in the hopes that it will be included in playlists marketed as containing
the best music to sleep to. The ultimate state of utility for music is then to
be unheard, at least consciously. It would be there to sooth if sleep was
interrupted perhaps is the thinking. When fractions of pennies per play are
offered to artist by the all encompssing platform the a whole nights worth of
plays is where the money is. Especially when you multiply it by the platform
pettling the good that is the playlist by use of algorithms. The data aggregated
from the entirety of the platform's users dictates that this is the most chill
music to sleep to. The resonance is inevitable. Feddback eventually rips
everything apart. Orubus clenches it's own tail, spiralling ever downward in
convulution and the most chill unfelt agony that is never learning of the grat
width and breadth of the provable infinite capacity for variaty that music
holds.

I'll never be a real composer. I'd like to think that I'll be able to make my
piece with that some day. In my mind there is an image that perfectly models
this: A locked door.

"...it is worth pointing out that lock picking is just one way to bypass a lock,
though it does cause less damage than brute force techniques. In fact, it may
be easier to bypass the bolt mechanism than to bypass the lock. It may also be
easier to bypass some other part of the door or even avoid the door entirely.
Remember: There is always another way, usually a better one."

Money pays salaries, funds nonprofits, buys art, funds grants. Does it matter
where it comes from? What makes certain money acceptable or not acceptable? Is
it: How it was made? Who it comes from? What is given in return? What it is
going towards? Our ethics and internal math may vary, but the question is
omnipresent.

"Authentic Computer Music."

Tell the story of how you heard as a child that the reason Hollywood scores in
general and strings in particular can sound so distinctly Hollywood is because
of the secret that they produce an amalgamy of the real and the fake. Forging the
two into a stronger material than either of the two on their own could ever be.
Perhaps even then I had the thought, or at least an ungraspable sense, without
knowing the word, inexpressable but profoundly experienced. The hyperReal.

Do you remember the story of Daft punk?

Everything was recorded onto analog tape in rarified recording palaces like New
York's Electric Lady and LA's Capitol Studios. Human spontaneity was coveted;
computers, with their tendency toward mindless repetition, were not.

“Technology has made music accessible in a philosophically interesting way,
which is great,” says Bangalter, talking about the proliferation of home
recording and the laptop studio. “But on the other hand, when everybody has the
ability to make magic, it's like there's no more magic—if the audience can just
do it themselves, why are they going to bother?”  

[link to source](https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/)

Ryan Dombal's Daft Punk interview for Pitchfork that came out in May 2013 is
riddled with descriptions of the interviewees affluence. We are told a story of
success through appearances. I imagine the article had the opposite of the
intended effect on me. I love the idea of democratising the means of
production.

“machine gunning” a rapid repeat of the same sample that gives the game away

Statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but
statements of what is known with different degrees of certainty.
_ Richard Feynman

All that can be heard is real. Only imaginings of sounds are unreal. There are
fictions. Narratives exist. We live alongside our lores. There are stories that
we tell each other, and that we tell ourselves. Admitting the impossibility in
knowing even one self. Certainly not each other. Definately not culture. We are
all choosing to live with these stories even as as we make increasingly feeble
attempts at that loftiest of goals of understanding, althemore likely settling
for ways to cope as we are strung along by each other.
