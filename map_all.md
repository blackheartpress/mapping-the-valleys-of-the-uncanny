# Introduction

Greg Egan writes in Diaspora:

"Every orphan was an explorer, sent to map uncharted territory. And every orphan
was the uncharted territory itself."

I've been a composer for a while now and I've engaged with music in a lot of
different ways through the course of getting to where I'm at now in this moment
that has me writing this text. There have been different frameworks at different
times and those different frameworks have all come bundled with their own set of
different limitations. It's difficult to take apart but I think that, at least
sometimes those limitations have inspired me. They definitely affected the way my
music sounded. One way that I like to think about these frameworks is the word
project. Learning to play the guitar was a project. Learning to record myself
playing guitar was another. Playing in a band came next. Learning to make songs
together with friends sprung to life out of that. Fast forward through all of
the links in the chain that has been my life to the overarching project of
organising sound and this particular example of that.


# Mapping The Valleys of The Uncanny 

[ An investigation into process and method within the field of algorithmic
composition. ]

Or:

[ The role of instrumentation and timbre as they unwittingly conspire to designate
access, power, work and ultimately class. ] 

This project is a collection of musical materials that explore the idea of the
uncanny valley as it relates to music being real, fake or some strange
combination of the two. This project is primarily one in which I produce sound
files. In a secondary capacity I am also producing a text file.

In my thesis I aim to present some of my thoughts on how my work writing code
and making music might be connected in some hopefully interesting ways to my
field. I am unlikely to be able to adequately convey my own origin story. Instead I'll
focus on stories I've been told about music, throughout my life, inside and
outside of academia. I have a strong suspicion that these stories have shaped my
coming into being as a composer. However difficult the task of introspection, and
ultimately to know one self proves to be, I at least regard these stories as a
source for clues as to why I am driven to do the things that I do. I don't think
that there can be anything like "the self" without others and that "the self" is
largely about imagining others view of yourself.

I'd also like to explore the possibility of making my thesis valuable to others
in terms of it's utility by including my code. My thinking here is that there
exists a certain kind of reader that won't want to sit through these touchy feely
meanderings unless there is a promise of some code that can be run at the end of
the day.

# Uncanniness

What does it mean to other people?  
adjective having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis; beyond
the ordinary or normal; extraordinary: uncanny accuracy; an uncanny knack of
foreseeing trouble.  mysterious; arousing superstitious fear or dread;
uncomfortably strange: Uncanny sounds filled the house.

Why am I drawn to it?  
It strikes me as contemporary and unexplored.

```

The role of instrumentation is on the one hand entirely arbitrary to me as I am
certain that the universe is fundamentally indifferent to my existence, and so,
subsequently to which sounds I sequence in what way. None the less
instrumentation is a source of immense fascination for me. Any sound could be
sequenced. Which sounds would I like to sequence? What are my preferences? I
know that I have at times let availability and prevalence to some extent dictate
my choices. I should like to address that with a number of works that make good
on promises of infinite abundance. After all anything is possible in Electronic
Music. Any sound at any time. Timbre of course fascinates composers. 

In my life I have come to regard certain sounds as desirable but illusive. The
price I've had to pay has sometimes been higher than I would have liked in order
to hear them for even the briefest of moments. I've had to work quickly and
compromise. I've felt that the prescribed modus operandi has been error prone
and difficult to utilize towards my ends of organising sound in the ways that I
prefer.

Within so called "New Music" there exists a great divide between the electronic
and the acoustic. Certain sounds are not easily reached for someone like me for
one reason or another.

As my work of organizing sound has led me further and further down the path of
algorithmic composition I have grown more and more interested in the role of
contexts and connotations that certain sounds bring about in an audience. I
never really had any deeper context for LinnDrum claps or Gabber kicks of my own
apart from the obvious fact that they are strictly out of bounds for anyone
looking to make serious music. While that forbidden quality still holds some
titillation I am now much more interested in my own coming into resonance. The
sounds I felt most strongly connected to coming up through New Music where
always out of reach. 

So in very practical terms: I've changed up my way of working. I am sequencing
audio files in a computer instead of writing scores for humans to either
misunderstand or not care about. New things are possible. I am happy and the
work is progressing.

Most of the time I feel like I'm a high functioning automaton at best and that
all of my veracious peaks of inspiration are just bright ideas channeled to me
through popular cultural imperialism. That for all of my talk of the need for
newness and weirdness in music I'm just regurgitating things I've heard. Things
I've been taught to think, do and to make into sound. So I struggle. With
tremendous doubt. I'm trying to find something new to say even though I know
everything has been said a thousand times. I guess I'd be lucky if I can end up
with a subtle difference in emphasis or tone. The information conveyed it self;
Now that would be something.  But that is so much further down the rabbit hole.

So certain things are different when sequencing sounds in a computer. Sounds can
be played faster. That's interesting because we have that faster playing in
music played by humans also. It's exciting because a lot of the time it gets
held up as virtuosic. We use phrases like gifted or talented musicians.  A
computer can play _exactly_ the same amplitude and timbre multiple times in a
row. Humans can't, well actually the constraint is higher up than that. Simple
physics, Newtonian forces won't allow it. We've never held that kind of
virtuosity up as equilibristic instrumentalist practice. I don't think we'd
react quite the same way if a human got even remotely close. "You sound like a
machine" they'd say. It would be derogatory. They might not even know what
machine they'd be referring to. It would be the sampler and more specifically
an early days sampler with a single layer of samples. No round-robin switching
out of the samples to mimic what happens "naturally" when a key is struck on a
Celesta. An infinite amount of the subtlest variation explodes out of that
action each time.


# The Real and the fake

(Big section proly. What is real? Ideally prove that all that can be heard is
real. Only imaginings are unreal) Fictions. Narratives. Lores. Stories we tell
ourselves. Admitting the impossibility in knowing one self and still choosing
to live with these stories as an attempt at that goal of understanding. I need
to tell the story of the Japanese poetry group around year 1000 who allowed
each other to take new names every decade or so to start each decade with a
fresh voice. To become the resplendent new. The untainted eye.  A new voice
thorugh which to speak about new perspectives. As many times
over as they wished for as long as they lived and wrote. That story is maybe
where I'd like  to go. To get to a point where I feel free to reinvent myself as
an artist.   

Get that sweet Zizek action in here.

The Lacanian Triad according to Zizek

That which resists symbolization

“The real is what resists symbolization absolutely.” ― Jacques Lacan, The
Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Freud's Papers on Technique

Define hyperReal. 
(link to Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality]

Even better than the real thing. 

Heightened states of being, as in the
impossibility of hearing a multitude of things sounding in a multitude spaces,
at a multitude of different times all at once. Transcending limitations of time
and space through non realTime assemblage. 

There is a line between The Real and the fake. This position is defended at any cost. The Real can not, _must_ not,
allow itself to be devalued. A great many people have invested heavily in doing
difficult things. Shortcuts are frowned upon.  

Authenticity of what exactly?
Value to be traded in for what?  
Tradition to be upheld for what purpose?
Cutting corners implies future weakness of structural integrity.  
And so it goes. Positions of power are upheld. Barriers to entry kept in place.  
Nothing we can do.  

"...through layers of diminishing reality"  

"...half-awake, unable to distinguish the virtual from the real"  

"...counterfeit unreality"

"Round Robins are a method of recording a number of performances of the same
sample so that when playing repeated notes in fast succession you don't get
“machine gunning” a rapid repeat of the same sample that gives the game away
immediately."

This quote taken from a SpitFire Audio manual for a percussion sample library.
If you decide to keep this then you should find it.

I can envision a future where people complain about musicians using telekinesis
and longing for the days when real musicians used computers.

# The MPC

(Origin stories, lore, compare the brush, hyperReal tape recorder, hi & lo
culture.)  

If the tape recorder was hyperReal then the MPC is hyperHyperReal
(compare postPostModern) and controlling Kontakt with SuperCollider is
infinitely hyperRealised in comparison to the original origin story.  

When the story of our origin (specifically Electronic Music's origin) is told
through the perspective of the tape recorder being the start . Then later the
tape recorder grows to the size of the studio with undeniable monumental
prestige. If we adjust the point of departure to a more recent technological
breakthrough then the scope of our story changes dramtically. To use the MPC as
the starting point for an alternative telling of history emerges as an
oppourtunity.  

The story we now construct has ramifications for where density occours. Closer
to our time. Preferably in the now. Year zero is no longer 1930 with that of
the Americans liberating the tape recorder from the rubble of nazi Germany.
Instead the year is 1988.    
Public Enemy burst into a popular culture running at
break-neck-speed with their debut release It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold
Us Back. Our origin story is no longer one of first meanderings of applying an
alien technology inside of a void. Instead the very modus operandi is
referentiality. The sampler and sampling not the tape recorder and tape
recordings. 

The history of Electronische Musik begins with the tape recorder and then
explodes outward into the physical monument of the studio. Our new origin story
is one of implosion. Both stories originate from a single machine.  

Sampler software inside of computers are direct descendants of the MPC. They now have no physical
form. They are software. The computer disappears into generalization.  A
computer can perform the task of any specialized machine like the tape recorder
or the sampler. A general purpose computer. Incorporeal. Purpose defined in
software.

It wasn't until much later that I realised that
the magical machine that I had heard about was the MPC. I first heard the story
when I was a kid listening to NWA, Public Enemy, De La Soul. Then finally when I was 
older from a guy who showed me J-Dilla's Donuts. He told me the story as we were 
listening to the album together. It was interleaved. The story was. It got 
interrupted by "oh oh and check this part out". Little things about the production. 
Details. They say the devil is in the details. Anyway I really got that story handed 
to me. The last celebrated experimental hip hop record. Didn't have any rapping on it.
The story goes he made it in the hospital as he was dying of a terminal illness.
Had his MPC on his belly in the hospital bed. I don't know if that's true. I
guess I've put off trying to find out if it's true because I like the story.
"A kiss may not be the truth but it's what we wish were true." That bit is from
Steve Martin's LA Story. In the movie I think we're meant to think it's a
Shakespeare quote. That's a another one I've thought a thousand times about and
never got to the bottom of.

There might be a way to way to fit the John Cage on tour in Europe with Earl
Brown and Christian Wolff story in here. The story goes that they were all on
tour together and their musics all utilized the idea that if there is a
sufficient amount of silence in between notes then the listener will forget the
previous note. John Cage finds that after hearing the same program being played
night after night in city after city he begins to hear melodies in all of their
pieces. Prolonged exposure. Even just practice. It ends up in your memory even if
you don't want it to. Cage focused on just the notes in this example. To my mind
there would have still been the compunded infinities of timbre and timing. With
the MPC in it's first iteration I'm thinking this was most apparent. Hit that
pad and get exactly the same sound every time. Later models in my time have been
marketed as having  velocity through pressure sensitivity bulit into the pads.
Not sure  but I think they returned to the flat no dynamics when they made an
iOS version. The MPC then acorporeal, reduced to pictures under glass. The
retriggering anyway. The "machineGunning". That's what I think became what made
the MPC so interesting in how it was perceived. Lifeless, or even undead, like a
zombie. The corpse moves, and in such marvellously different ways.

Sampling as a radical act? Here then maybe the idea that there were
possibilities presented to artists in the past (a very special brush) that for
whatever reason have been insufficiently explored. Paradoxically taking on the
role of the old hat at the same time. FM certainly is like that. Additive
synthesis as well. These two examples can easily be thought of through a purely
technical perspective. Since both FM and additive synthesis offer an apparant
abundance in the parameter space it becomes a problem of organsing efforts to
explore them in powerful (abstracted) ways. We are left to our own devices here.
We are not posing a threat to anyone noodling around inside of our belly buttons
engaging with this work. On the other hand sampling isn't comparatively  as
underexplored from a technical perspective. Might could be that there could be a
case to make about how sampling could be underexplored from a referential and
social perspective. This is largely due to how frought with legal concerns
sampling became. There was, I think, a panic that spread quickly. A scrambling
then ensued to safeguard intellectual property belonging to large corporations.

# Pine cones are magical

(I'd like to change your mind about everything you know in your heart of hearts
to be true) Up is down. Bad is good.  While I don't believe in actual magic I
find this passage from Jarod Anderson's The CryptoNaturalist useful for purposes
of illustration:

"Pine cones are beautiful, geometric wonders that are only devalued by their
abundance. Fractal sculptures. Evergreen snowflakes. Blossoms in wood.
(Familiarity can rust magic. A little mental effort returns the shine.)" 

_ The CryptoNaturalist @CryptoNature 2018-08-24

[link to tweet](https://twitter.com/CryptoNature/status/1032808690292797440)

I would like to return the shine, as it were, to the task of organising sound in
general and to working with algorithmic composition in particular. 
Stretch goals would be to influence people to join me in rewiring the term
Computer Music to hold a new meaning. One tailored specifically to fit our time.
As computers are no longer held in artificial scarcity but rather available in
abundance new ways of thinking and acting in the world are possible.

Oram's new Atlantis:
“We have also sound-houses, where we practise and demonstrate all sounds, and
their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and
lesser slides of sounds. Divers instruments of music likewise to you unknown,
some sweeter than any you have, together with bells and rings that are dainty
and sweet. We represent small sounds as great and deep; likewise great sounds
extenuate and sharp; we make divers tremblings and warblings of sounds, which in
their original are entire. We represent and imitate all articulate sounds and
letters, and the voices and notes of beasts and birds. We have certain helps
which set to the ear do further the hearing greatly. We have also divers strange
and artificial echoes, reflecting the voice many times, and as it were tossing
it: and some that give back the voice louder than it came, some shriller, and
some deeper; yea, some rendering the voice differing in the letters or
articulate sound from that they receive. We have also means to convey sounds in
trunks and pipes, in strange lines and distances.”

_ “The New Atlantis” – Francis Bacon, 1623

That's some story. Actually, for me it's a story wrapped in another story.
Daphne Oram put that quote on the wall at The BBC Radiophonic Workshop and
_that's_ the story I've been told.
 
Do you remember the story of Daft punk? 
Everything was recorded onto analog tape in rarified recording palaces like New
York's Electric Lady and LA's Capitol Studios. Human spontaneity was coveted;
computers, with their tendency toward mindless repetition, were not.

“Technology has made music accessible in a philosophically interesting way,
which is great,” says Bangalter, talking about the proliferation of home
recording and the laptop studio. “But on the other hand, when everybody has the
ability to make magic, it's like there's no more magic—if the audience can just
do it themselves, why are they going to bother?”  

[link](https://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/daft-punk/)

Ryan Dombal's Daft Punk interview for Pitchfork that came out in May 2013 is
riddled with descriptions of the interviewees affluence. We are told a story of
success through appearances. I imagine the article had the opposite of the
intended effect on me. I love the idea of democratising the means of
production.

Take your fingers right up to your ears. As close as you can get them without
touching your ears. Now rub your fingers together ever so gently. You can hear
that can't you. Now imagine trying to hear such a faint sound across from a
concert hall or even just a stage. You would not be able to. Now image an
orchestra. Something close to a hundred people. They wouldn't be able to fit
there with all of their instruments in that close proximity where you heard that
faint sound of your fingers rubbing together just now. Right there is where I
put the microphone. Each time, as close as I can get it. For each instrument and
sometimes even changing the placement to optimize fully for a particular
articulation.


# Rooms

(Ties into place. The absurdity and poetic nature of imagining believing that a
photograph can steal a soul) I've come to understand that my fascination for
room tones is connected to my confusion about my class identity. Mimer first. I
didn't realize it at the time.  And then later, The Machine Hall in Ställberg.
It was right under my nose then but it took me quite a while to piece the puzzle
together. It's impossible for the narrative component of which space I use to
travel to the distance to the listener on it's own. For me it's different. I
know the name of the convolution file. I can imagine the workers there. Through
a wrinkle in time. Working, ceaselessly, dutifully. And now that the lightning
has been caught in the bottle I can imagine that work filling that room with
sound. From the lowest rumbles through the spectrum all the way up the ladder to
the harshest height of the audible spectrum. At the end of it we subtract time
and we've captured if not the room itself then it's essence, or if you care to
indulge me, it's soul. My fascination has been focusing in on trying to pin down
the work that happened there. It can't be saved for later and understood given
enough time. My origin story will always elude me. If these walls could talk we
say. My thoughts connect things up and make patterns. Compare another cavernous
room tone; The church. A place of worship. A place to wonder in awe of god's
greatness. The organ was the first big organised sound. That room is part of how
we've heard that instrument. The resonance. Place and narrative intersect in the
tone of the room. As the room resonates we are brought into resonance with
ideas. I never believed in god. I never believed that narrative. I know work was
real. The workers were real. Their struggle was real. I believe in that
narrative.

Place: Make the case that a piece of code can be thought of as sculpture or as a
place. What are some examples of nice places? The stone garden is a nice story.
The shopping mall is another place. Not as nice a place.  

# State

The code is static. Why is that important?  The frozen state yielding a
multitude of infinities in variation through time fascinates me. Feels
paradoxical. Goes on to talk about complexity. The scope or sampling window
matters.  Static or in flux. The fan in the Robert Miles on AI safety video is
the initial instance that made me think of this.  Has to do with the
presentation aspect. I work on the code until it reaches a static state which is
most to my liking. While I might not listen to an eternity's worth of the
generated material I'll listen to a good long while. The longest I have in the
past listened to a material to make sure I liked all of the material I generated
with a static piece of code is 8 and a half hours. I did that for No value
without utility which can be found here:
[link](https://danielmkarlsson.github.io/)

By projecting static code in combination with fixed media is for the greater
part due to my fascination for complexity emerging out of simplicity. To a
smaller degree I cant help but go against the prescribed modus operandi of
playing the code within so called live coding like an instrument. That is not
what I want to do. I want to organise sound in a very specific way. Another nice
aspect of static code is that it greatly increases portability. I think I'd be a
lot more interested in distributing something that was not video. Who knows what
the future will hold.

Might be fun also to touch briefly on the idea of state as memory as in
functional programming in general and Haskell in particular. At least the
personal encounters part. That whole engage with it as lore thing again.

"The only state is time"  
How to talk about this without giving power to it's source?
 
"It's all dead simple, I have no real interest in technical complexity, and this
music has a streamlined quality I admire. No gesture is strained or wasted and
the music is complex, the technology is simple, a better way round than the age
old problem of academic electronic music where muscular technology too often
produces pissweak sounds."

# The Believing Game

The task at hand is mainly organising sound. My ambition is to present a number
of materials, both in thought and in music. In doing so I hope to "tune" the
listener's perception of the musical works held within the project through the
means of text in order to allow for the possibility of greater immersion. 

When I was a kid I would sometimes stare for long stretches of time at high
ceilings imagining what it would be like to be in that upside down world in the
ceiling. To walk around up there, looking up at the world down here. For
everything to be so different, about the way we perceive this place, where we
are now. You are reluctant to have your perspective changed. Your world views
are pretty much set. Let's play a game you and I. It's called: The Believing
Game.  

I most likely will have to reference

# Conclusion: The Impossibility of The Maps

Nothing is real, everything is permitted. 

The source for this is acknowledged by Burroughs himself in Minutes to Go, p.
61: Nothing is true all is permitted. Last words [of] Hassan Sabbah.
The Old Man of the Mountain quoted from The Master of the Assassins by
Betty Bouthoul. 

[Link to source](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/jefftaylor/publications/origins/)

The quote keeps popping up. Later on in a videogame called
Assasins Creed. Everyone is sampling it. The origin is more blurred by every use
of it. It especially affects searchability on The Public Internet as the search
engine (you know which one, the dominant one) is "optimizing" by finding and
flaming resonances. When the resonace becomes feedback it can be used as a
signal.

Music appreciation is subjective. Who'd a thunk it?

The only satisfactions available are the satisfactions of reality, which are
themselves frustrating.
: Adam Phillips

Preferences of style exist, aesthetics do not. Since there is no god there can
be no divine beauty. We are left to our own devices down here. We have to make
up our own minds about what we prefer.

So the jist of this text is this: During my Master which was 2017 to 2019 I
changed my way of working with music in a few different ways. Part of it was
changing out the tools I used. I went from using TidaCycles to using
SuperCollider. From using SuperDirt as my sampler to instead using Kontakt. From
using AudioMulch to using Reaper for doing real time post production. So some of
the names of the tools changed but the functionality broadly speaking stayed the
same. The modus operandi is still: Write code that triggers samples and then
apply effects in some kind of DAW-like environment in order to express my
musical ideas. Why should I express my musical ideas? Because I want to and
because I can. The possibility exists and I am drawn to it. The way I make music
is dependant on tools. The tools should be open for others to study and use. If
I don't take measures to make my tools available to others then I am kicking out
the rungs beneath me as I climb upward.

On a cenceptual or extra musical level however I am obliged to admit, however
reluctantly, that something changed. Anyone who knows me is always hearing me
tell the same story. About how fundamentally music is incapable of depicting
anything because of the fact that it is inherently abstract and utterly
ephemeral. Despite of how many times I have told that story both to myself, to
my friends and basically anyone within earshot I ended up making a strange kind
of programme music myself. I got to thinking, perhaps too much, about my
environment and about the people I met there. How they work and also about why
they work in the ways that they work. What their goals are. The project ended up
describing my thoughts and emotions about being back in that old world. Feeling
much the same way as before. Like a thief at a cocktail party, trying to blend
in, eating hors d'oeuvres and failing to exchange pleasentries, sweating
profusely, certain of being found out and subsequently thrown out, any second
now. 

### Below are unsorted snippets of random things

If you are doing creative work then to some extent, sure, I think it could be a
good idea to try to write down some of your thoughts about the task at hand from
your perspective. There are a lot of different ways that you could do that. 

"...some are good, some are bad, some are just ok."  - Quentin Dupieux from Lambs Anger

Quotes are a socially exceptable form of sampling.

How about narrative and place as two examples of two possible extra musical paths to engagement.

The Vivaldi was a publisher story. The unlikeliness that program music will be
real. Most likely a marketing ploy to pettle goods of some kind. In Vivaldi's
time sheet music was the product. I remember the time in my life when as a
teenager I would go to a record store to listen to music and decide which CD I
would buy. I could afford to buy one per month. I was building my collection
slowly this way. Then later because a lot of strange and complicated reasons I
started lend/leasing compressed files through a platform. I did this through
monthlu subscription which coincidentally is the same amount I paid for the one
CD a month. The say you can listen to any music through this platform but I know
that's not true. The platform being there and seeming so very unquestionable
has led to people attempting to game it. The blandest, most chill music is being
made in the hopes that it will be included in playlists marketed as containing
the best music to sleep to. The ultimate state of utility for music is then to
be unheard, at least consciously. It would be there to sooth if sleep was
interrupted perhaps is the thinking. When fractions of pennies per play are
offered to artist by the all encompssing platform the a whole nights worth of
plays is where the money is. Especially when you multiply it by the platform
pettling the good that is the playlist by use of algorithms. The data aggregated
from the entirety of the platform's users dictates that this is the most chill
music to sleep to. The resonance is inevitable. Feddback eventually rips
everything apart. Orubus clenches it's own tail, spiralling ever downward in
convulution and the most chill unfelt agony that is never learning of the grat
width and breadth of the provable infinite capacity for variaty that music
holds.

I'll never be a real composer. I'd like to think that I'll be able to make my
piece with that some day. In my mind there is an image that perfectly models
this: A locked door.

"...it is worth pointing out that lock picking is just one way to bypass a lock,
though it does cause less damage than brute force techniques. In fact, it may
be easier to bypass the bolt mechanism than to bypass the lock. It may also be
easier to bypass some other part of the door or even avoid the door entirely.
Remember: There is always another way, usually a better one."

The human mind (mine too) loves narratives. Stories.

Stories are illusion. They are so powerful they invite delusion.

What’s a workaround?

Money pays salaries, funds nonprofits, buys art, funds grants. Does it matter
where it comes from? What makes certain money acceptable or not acceptable? Is
it: How it was made? Who it comes from? What is given in return? What it is
going towards? Our ethics and internal math may vary, but the question is
omnipresent.

"Authentic Computer Music."

Tell the story of how you heard as a child that the reason Hollywood scores in
general and strings in particular can sound so distinctly Hollywood is because
of the secret that they produce an amalgamy of the real and the fake. Forging the
two into a stronger material than either of the two on their own could ever be.
Perhaps even then I had the thought, or at least an ungraspable sense, without
knowing the word, inexpressable but profoundly experienced. The hyperReal.
